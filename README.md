# School_District_Analysis


1. Overview of the School District Analysis
	
	The purpose of this analysis was to summarize and examine data on student funding and standardized test scores across multiple schools in differing districts. Using our findings, we were able to distinctively categorize math and reading scores for each grade level by school type, school size, and the funding allocated for each student. For Thomas High School, Maria was able to identify trends in overall school performance once the math and reading scores were replaced for the ninth graders.
